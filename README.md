## _Story Behind the Dashboard_
At the beginning of 2024, what started as a casual habit turned into an insightful Excel dashboard by the year's end. I began casually noting down the films I watched along with their release years in Google Notes on my phone. By the end of the year, I had accumulated a dataset of around 150 films.

Curious to uncover patterns, I decided to analyze the data. However, I only had the film names and their release years. To enrich the dataset, I loaded it into Excel and used Power Query's Advanced Editor. With the help of ChatGPT, I generated code to fetch additional details (e.g., runtime, IMDB ratings, box office collection, etc.) using the OMDB APIâ€”marking my first experience with APIs. After cleaning and transforming the data, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize my 2024 movie-watching journey.

## _Overview_
The dataset contained 149 rows and multiple columns such as:

+ Movie Name
+ Release Year
+ Director
+ IMDB Rating
+ Box Office Revenue
+ Release Date
+ Content Rating

## _Key Steps_
+ Data Enrichment: Fetched movie details using the OMDB API.
+ Data Cleaning: Handled null and missing values, changed column types, and transformed data for analysis.
+ Visualization: Designed an interactive dashboard to showcase insights and patterns.
